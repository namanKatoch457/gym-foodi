Gym Foodi is a dynamic web application designed for fitness enthusiasts, gym-goers, and health-conscious individuals to help them achieve their fitness goals through proper nutrition. The platform provides a wide range of curated food categories, including options for weight gain, weight loss, vegetarian, and non-vegetarian diets. By focusing on health-centric meals, Gym Foodi ensures that users can conveniently access the food they need to complement their fitness routines.

Users can browse the menu, which is categorized to suit diverse nutritional requirements. Whether the goal is muscle building, fat loss, or maintaining a balanced diet, the app offers tailored meal options with detailed descriptions, including calorie count and nutritional value. This transparency helps users make informed choices.

The project integrates several functionalities to enhance the user experience. Users can place orders directly through the app, and they can choose to either pick up their meals from the restaurant or dine in. The admin panel allows restaurant owners to manage the menu effortlessly, adding or updating food items as needed.

Additionally, the app incorporates Twilio for real-time notifications, ensuring users receive updates on their orders. When an order is placed, the user gets a confirmation message along with all the necessary details, such as order summary and expected pickup time. This feature provides seamless communication and improves service efficiency.

Currently operating on a cash-on-delivery model, Gym Foodi aims to provide a hassle-free experience for its users. Built using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the platform combines robust backend functionality with an intuitive and responsive design. This project is a step towards bridging the gap between fitness and nutrition by making healthy eating accessible and convenient.
